# To-Do-App-2022

Everyone wants to do things "better." A to-do list app lets a user store information to be recalled later. This full-stack project should let the user:

* Store, retrieve, and modify "to do" information within a database
* View "to do" information in a clean, attractive format
* View the application on a mobile computer or desktop computer
